## Plan
For a successfull session we start with the Week's agenda:
- Define and distinguish between Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence
- Explore different jobs related to Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence
- Outline the Data Science Methodology in line with best practice standards e.g. CRISP-DM
- Identify real-world applications and case studies of each
- Working on the first Data Project on Web Data Scraping

Let dive into the making of each point.

## Define and distinguish between Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence
1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Definition
Artificial Intelligence is the broad field focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
Key idea
Making machines intelligent
Examples
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Game-playing systems (e.g., chess engines)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Expert systems
  
AI includes rule-based systems, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

2. Machine Learning (ML)
Definition
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.
Key idea
Learning patterns from data
Common techniques
- Linear regression
- Decision trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Examples
- Email spam detection
- Recommendation systems
- Credit scoring

3. Deep Learning (DL)

Definition
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns in large datasets.
Key idea
Learning hierarchical representations using neural networks
Characteristics
- Requires large amounts of data
- High computational power (GPUs/TPUs)
- Excels in unstructured data

Examples
- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Self-driving car vision systems

4. Data Science (DS)

Definition
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting insights and knowledge from data using statistics, programming, and domain expertise.

Key idea
Turning data into actionable insights

Components
- Data collection and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis
- Machine Learning models
- Data visualization and communication

Examples
- Business analytics dashboards
- Sales forecasting
- Customer behavior analysis
